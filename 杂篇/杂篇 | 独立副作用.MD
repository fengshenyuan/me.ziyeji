**Work for No More Workings**

My goal for the rest of working is

- work for yrself not other companies

- work for the beauty and real world not part of dead or the MACHINE

- work for the kind and the inner desire of yr heart  

When u want to get hired and then u're put yrself on the learning actully u don't like or really need, u're working for working

- u should never work for work

- u will strive for this through yr whole life

That's our goal. That's the hope.

****

世上有一种人很可恨，破坏别人幸福的人；世上有一种人很可爱，追寻自己幸福的人。当两者相遇，二者不可得兼，你难道要做一个忍气吞声，畏畏缩缩的人么？

****

一个人的时候就是这么懦弱无能，两个人的时候就是那么勇敢无谓。
